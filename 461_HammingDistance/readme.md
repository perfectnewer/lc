The Hamming distance between two integers in the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integerw x and y,calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 <= x, y < 2^31.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ^   ^

The above arrows points to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
